# Image-Organizer
An image organizing tool


I am building it in Python 3 as a way to practice building a tkinter GUI and to try to build something that I sort of want for myself. First step is to get it working, but I'll be cleaning it up after I'm done.

There is currently a bug when loading a lot of images at once where the image library reports a memory error. I read online it might be a bug in the library, but it could also be something I did. Still working on this.
